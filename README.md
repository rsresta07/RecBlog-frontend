# RecBlog

I started this project as well as a way to make myself more familiar with the frontend side of Full Stack using NextJS, Mantine and TailwindCSS. Later on (currently) this has become my Final Year Project for BCA.

The backend part of this project can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/rsresta07/kathanika-blog-backend).

There may be a lot of things I have made mistake and a lot of things that I may be able to improve. I will leave it to future [Rameshwor](https://github.com/rsresta07).

## TODO
