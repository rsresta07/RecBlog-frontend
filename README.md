# RecBlog

I started RecBlog as well as a way to make myself more familiar with the frontend side of Full Stack using NextJS, Mantine and TailwindCSS.

The backend part of this project can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/rsresta07/kathanika-blog-backend).

There may be a lot of things I have made mistake and a lot of things that I may be able to improve. I will leave it to future [Rameshwor](https://github.com/rsresta07).

## TODO

- [ ] make CommonForm for add post, edit post, and edit profile
