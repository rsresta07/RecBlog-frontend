# RecBlog

I started RecBlog as well as a way to make myself more familiar with the frontend side of Full Stack using NextJS, Mantine and TailwindCSS.

The backend part of this project can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/rsresta07/kathanika-blog-backend).

There may be a lot of things I have made mistake and a lot of things that I may be able to improve. I will leave it to future [Rameshwor](https://github.com/rsresta07) ahaha...

### Initial Plan

The initial plan for RecBlog was to have users who can login and register, they can read other users blogs while also add their own blogs. The blog itself is not that fancy: title, cover image, tags, content of the blog, likes, comment and follow.

So, RecBlog is a multiple user blogging platform that consist of two algorithms. Content-based filtering (`cosine similarity` + `Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency` inspired `Inverse Frequency`) and Collaborative filtering (User-based filtering - _will be explained later on_).

You know basic stuff _but_ it to be fully production ready project!

One of the main reason why I wanted to create a complete simple production ready web application is because, I had realized I have never created personal project that is complete haha..

So enough chitchat and lets go deeper into this project in which I know i have messed up a lot of things.

For detailed developer notes, see [docs/developer-notes.md](./docs/developer-notes.md)
